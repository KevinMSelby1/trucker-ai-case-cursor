Then talk you into a deal that is definately not worth it. Once you find out they barely have any loads they refuse to refund. There are alot better apps out there for loads and ELD service.

Those stops can't even accommodate a single truck on their lots. I guess developer thinks he's fooling us when all he's doing is infuriating us.

Now, it just shows a ""P"" and is red yellow or green. Or the truck stop logo and all the pins are red. Why would they do this? You now have to click more to know the same amount of information. Also, If you search for a place and click ""show on map"", the only pin you see is that one place. Now go back to the main map and you lost that location and have no way of returning without scrolling with your finger and hoping to find that location just so you know what else is in that area. This app was not developed with the fact that 99% of the time it is being used while driving. It isn't designed by drivers and the developers really don't understand the concept of being user friendly. It has potential but they currently have no desire to make things easier to use, the proof is that 4th parking availability tab. I don't want to give comments a thumbs up or down, this isn't YouTube. I want to find a place to park so I can get some rest. I emailed my inquiry and they responded with an automated response thanking me for my input, no actual conversation about why they changed it and how it is supposedly safer to click more while you are driving. They have made it less safe and don't care about it. I canceled my subscription, they don't get anymore of my money.",1,3,3.3.1,2018-12-15 17:25:09,,

Us drivers know when we get there, because there is a dam sign that says open or closed.  ALSO I don't care about the scale house for the opposite traffic.  SO QUIT ASKING ME ABOUT THAT TOO.  this is why I am giving you a 1 star and which I could give zero.  There should be a option in the app that enables you to not ask about that stuff while driving.  Let alone you should make a drive mode option.

Wow. As this app gets more popular the greed of its makers increases. I've been using this app for 2 years. I got annoyed a while ago when they allowed truck stops to pay them to have their icons stay on the map permanently, no matter how you adjust the filters. I purposely avoid those places because of that annoyance. Now a monthly subscription ""premium"" service with no ads and night mode. Worth the price? NOT EVEN CLOSE. Expect them to make the ads more annoying so you will become a premium member. Also expect them to remove normal features of the app that they will put behind the $2/mo paywall. It's going downhill fast folks. They're seeing nothing but dollar signs. I understand they have every right to profit off of this app, but a subscription service is not the way. It feels so sleezy.
