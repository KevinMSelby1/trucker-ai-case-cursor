I've been using this app for 2 years. I got annoyed a while ago when they allowed truck stops to pay them to have their icons stay on the map permanently, no matter how you adjust the filters. I purposely avoid those places because of that annoyance. Now a monthly subscription ""premium"" service with no ads and night mode. Worth the price? NOT EVEN CLOSE. Expect them to make the ads more annoying so you will become a premium member. Also expect them to remove normal features of the app that they will put behind the $2/mo paywall. It's going downhill fast folks. They're seeing nothing but dollar signs. I understand they have every right to profit off of this app, but a subscription service is not the way. It feels so sleezy. Suggestion: a one time fee of $5. I'd pay that.",1,5,2.1.1,2017-05-08 14:30:16,nan,

I could care less about seeing a list or having to click more info on a list. It's just an added unnecessary thing to do. Y'all could mess up a wet dream.

When planning a trip with multiple stops, it sometimes has a tendency to re-order the stops into a not logical order. I try to reorder them back and it often won't let me set them to where they need to be. I usually have to clear the whole trip out and create the plan anew. Sometimes it tries to route me back to a previous stop. After I tried one last time to view the trip plan to get ETA for today's stops, it scrambled them again. Also, it uses Google Speech for spoken directions. This is significantly quieter than music if provided on the same device and there doesn't seem to be any way to fix that.",1,34,5.1.6,2021-08-16 20:38:44,"We appreciate your real time feedback of your Trucker Path experience, Stephen.

72695405-fe09-49ae-9fc4-aff9f7405f84,A Google user,"it was a great app. Then they added a 4th tab for parking availability. Before, the color of the pin represented the parking availability and showed the truck stop logo. Now, you can either know what the availability is or what truck stop it is in the map view. Now, it just shows a ""P"" and is red yellow or green. Or the truck stop logo and all the pins are red. Why would they do this? You now have to click more to know the same amount of information. Also, If you search for a place and click ""show on map"", the only pin you see is that one place. Now go back to the main map and you lost that location and have no way of returning without scrolling with your finger and hoping to find that location just so you know what else is in that area. This app was not developed with the fact that 99% of the time it is being used while driving. It isn't designed by drivers and the developers really don't understand the concept of being user friendly. It has potential but they currently have no desire to make things easier to use, the proof is that 4th parking availability tab. I don't want to give comments a thumbs up or down, this isn't YouTube. I want to find a place to park so I can get some rest. I emailed my inquiry and they responded with an automated response thanking me for my input, no actual conversation about why they changed it and how it is supposedly safer to click more while you are driving.
