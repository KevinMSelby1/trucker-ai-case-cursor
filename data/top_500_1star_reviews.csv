Before their update I would scroll ahead on my trip to try to plan out where to stop at but the app won't allow me to do so anymore. It keeps going back to where I currently am. Also the app won't stay zoomed in. It automatically zooms itself back out. I want it to do what I want, not have a mind of its own! I'll be looking for a replacement now.",1,116,4.3.8,2021-03-29 20:07:57,"Hi Shelly, we are sorry to hear that you're dissatisfied with our latest release.

Then it was the flood of all the alternative services for which had no use. But now, on top of there being ads, the ads seem to come up every 30 seconds or every 3 or 4 times I hit a button. And to top that off, after every ad is dismissed I have to click the box that says I want to continue with ads! Which is essentially an ad for ads!

99731b55-5e57-4495-bf91-f7de404339dd,A Google user,I don't usually write reviews but I'm so upset about the direction this app is going in. I get the ads... It's super annoying but I can understand that. Every free app has ads. I'm so mad about all the places on the map that I can't remove. I loved this app because I could choose and see only the places that I actually wanted to see and it made it easy to look for places and trip plan. Now the map is crowded up with a million little places that I could care less about and they block what I want.,1,105,4.0.2,2020-04-21 15:04:13,No Reply,

You can't find desired truck stops, because there's a lot of ads' markers. You can't just uncheck them. Oh and it's not all.

If you want an app that overheats your phone to the point that it actually causes damage to the phone and then the phone starts glitching because of the app and is insanely hot to touch the directions from it are okay. Sometimes the map doesn't want to work at all and sometimes it does. It just depends on what the app is feeling like that day.

In the beginning you were able to open the app, search for the nearest truck stop, and get a general idea of the location to the truck stop (most of us only need a highway and an exit number).

What makes it worse is that the ads are for games and other irrelevant junk. I refuse to pay for this app. What makes the ads sadder is the tech team says it helps pay to keep the app up to date. How does free games that are essentially the same thing as this app (pay if you want) help pay for future updates? Personally this app has turned into every other play store app like this and that's junk.,1,16,3.8.4,2020-01-23 17:34:04,No Reply,

cf2402fb-5ca2-4545-85a2-8322d5cac13e,A Google user,if you guys can add truck route directions as Google map or Sygic truck map works. i will give it 5 stars and buy the premium happily for sure. There is a routing thing in the app but is this the way map routing is used by the drivers ? there should be a reason to keep this app running on phone screen for 10 hours straight. Truck gps give the route and tells about the weight scale ahead 5 kms in advance. this app should also do that. app is a great idea but poorly executed. sorry,1,6,3.4.3,2019-03-16 12:06:01,No Reply,

And also won't show you which direction you have to go just 1-40 won't tell you west or south so get ready for alot of wrong exits if you driving a semi truck.

I've been using this app for 2 years. I got annoyed a while ago when they allowed truck stops to pay them to have their icons stay on the map permanently, no matter how you adjust the filters. I purposely avoid those places because of that annoyance. Now a monthly subscription ""premium"" service with no ads and night mode. Worth the price? NOT EVEN CLOSE. Expect them to make the ads more annoying so you will become a premium member. Also expect them to remove normal features of the app that they will put behind the $2/mo paywall. It's going downhill fast folks. They're seeing nothing but dollar signs. I understand they have every right to profit off of this app, but a subscription service is not the way. It feels so sleezy.
